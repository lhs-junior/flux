| Code Deletion | **Deletes code written before tests** | Warnings only (user-friendly) |
| Planning | Built-in planning system | Integrated with our Planning |
| Agent System | Subagent-driven development | Integrated with our Agents |
| Test Runner | Framework-specific | Auto-detect (Jest/Vitest/Mocha) |
| Storage | Git-based | SQLite with history |
| Complexity | High (complete workflow) | Low (4 simple tools) |
| Integration | Standalone | Synergizes with Memory + Agents + Planning |

### Testing

3. **No subagents**: Original has its own agent system - we use ours
4. **Focused extraction**: Only absorbed TDD enforcement, not entire framework

**Merge approach for Planning conflict**:
- Extended existing Planning with `type='tdd'` instead of separate systems
- Unified TODO tree shows both regular and TDD tasks
- Single source of truth for all task tracking

- **Original**: [Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode)
- **Tools**: 5 (`agent_spawn`, `agent_status`, `agent_result`, `agent_terminate`, `agent_list`)
- **Our Improvements**:
  - Parallel async execution (not sequential)
  - Real-time progress monitoring
  - Background task support

### Next Absorption

- **v0.2.0 (Feb 2025)**: [planning-with-files](https://github.com/OthmanAdi/planning-with-files)
  - TODO tracking with dependency management
  - Expected: +3 tools, 86/100 quality score

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added

#### Phase 1: Core Gateway
- Core MCP Gateway implementation with multi-server support
- MCP server client with automatic reconnection logic (3 retries, 1s interval)
- Session management for tracking connected servers
- Tool call proxying to underlying MCP servers
- Basic tool registration and metadata storage

#### Phase 2: BM25 Tool Search Engine
- BM25-powered search engine with sub-millisecond performance (<1ms)
- Okapi BM25 algorithm implementation (k1=1.2, b=0.75)
- Tool indexing with document frequency calculation
- Query-based tool ranking and relevance scoring

#### Phase 3: GitHub Auto-Discovery
- GitHub API integration using @octokit/rest
- Automatic MCP server discovery from GitHub repositories
- Topic-based search (mcp-server, mcp)
- Name pattern matching for MCP servers
- README and description keyword search
- Rate limit handling and caching support

#### Phase 4: Intent Classification
- Query intent analysis for tool categorization
- Action normalization (read, write, delete, etc.)
- Domain classification (communication, database, filesystem, development, web, ai)
- Entity extraction from queries
- Synonym expansion and query enhancement
- Stop words filtering

#### Phase 5: Usage Learning
- SQLite-based persistence for tool metadata and usage logs
- Usage tracking and statistics
- Logarithmic boost for frequently used tools
- Tool usage history for personalized recommendations

#### Phase 6: Production-Ready Implementation
- 3-layer intelligent tool loading strategy:
  - **Layer 1**: Essential tools (always loaded, ~1.5K tokens)
  - **Layer 2**: BM25-matched tools (dynamic, 10-15 tools, ~3-4.5K tokens)
  - **Layer 3**: On-demand tools (loaded when explicitly requested)
- CLI interface with commands:
  - `discover`: Search and install MCP servers from GitHub
  - `list`: List installed plugins
  - `stats`: Show gateway statistics
  - `start`: Start the gateway server
- Quality evaluation system (0-100 scoring):
  - Popularity (0-25): GitHub stars, forks
  - Maintenance (0-25): Recent commits, project age
  - Documentation (0-25): README, package.json quality
  - Reliability (0-25): Issue ratio, versioning
- Interactive installation workflow
- Production-ready MCP server integration

### Performance

#### Token Reduction
- 50 tools: 70% reduction (15,000 → 4,500 tokens)
- 200 tools: 90% reduction (60,000 → 6,000 tokens)
- 500 tools: 95% reduction (150,000 → 7,500 tokens)

#### Search Speed
- 50 tools: 0.16-0.45ms (110x faster than 50ms target)
- 100 tools: 0.30-0.38ms (130x faster than 50ms target)
- 200 tools: 0.57-0.77ms (65x faster than 50ms target)

### Testing
